# Library-Management-System
* A simple libary management system built using `ASP.NET` and `C#.` 
# Features
* An  __administration panel__ that would allow a "librarian" to manage a database containing information about the following:
    * Books present in the library
    * Books that are borrowed from the library
    * Accounts associated with registered users of the site
* Pages that allow regular users to simply browse the site and __search__ for books to borrow from the library.
* A page that allows users to __manage__ borrowed materials from the library

# Notes
* This project uses several files from [`Bootstrap 4`](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [`Font Awesome`](https://fontawesome.com/).
* The developers would like to thank the owners of the images present in the pages. 
* We would also like to thank the developers of the [`NYU Libraries`](https://library.nyu.edu/) website for inspiring various aspects of this project.
